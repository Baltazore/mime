Low quality / low effort issues make me grumpy and cause me to respond in [ways I'm not proud of](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/638#issuecomment-1152382769).  So let's avoid that unpleasantness by having you do the following:

1. If your issue is related to a specific MIME type / extension, please verify the problem doesn't originate in [the mime-db project](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db) (where this project gets it's data from)
2. Make the title descriptive, specific to your problem, and SEO-friendly.
3. If your issue involves an error message or stacktrace _of any sort_, PROVIDE AN [MRE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)

I cannot emphasize that last point enough.  A stacktrace or error message by itself is rarely helpful.  You must include an MRE in one of the following forms:

|   |   |
|---|---|
| ðŸ™‚ Acceptable | Code and instructions for reproducing the problem attached to your issue |
| ðŸ˜ƒ Better | Code and instructions in a public repository |
| ðŸ¥³ Best | Project on a sandbox service such as [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.com/) |

> "I don't have time to read that MRE article"
>
> "I don't have time to make an MRE"
>
> "I don't know how to make an MRE"
>
> "Making an MRE is hard"

Then don't bother creating an issue.
